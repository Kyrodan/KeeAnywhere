# Getting started
* [What is KeeAnywhere?](https://github.com/Kyrodan/KeeAnywhere/wiki)
* [Screenshots](https://github.com/Kyrodan/KeeAnywhere/wiki/Screenshots)
* [Download](https://github.com/Kyrodan/KeeAnywhere/releases)


# Prerequisites
* KeePass 2.31 or newer
* Windows 7 or newer
* .Net Framework 4.5


# Known noteworthy issues:
* Registering a Dropbox account on Windows 7 opens the default browser at the end of the registration process. This window/tab could be ignored/closed.
* Registration process for Google Drive takes place in default browser. At the end of the registration process an error occures: this does not interfere with KeeAnywhere. Just close the browser window/tab.
